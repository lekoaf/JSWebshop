JSWebshop
=========

Work in progress!

Play project mainly to learn how to use Namespaces.

At the moment just a very simple Node JS backend with
a HTML, Bootstrap, JavaScript / jQuery frontend.

A webshop that pulls categorys and items from a JSON
file and presents them. You can't even send an order yet.
Working on that. :)
